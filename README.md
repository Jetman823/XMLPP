# XmlPP
Modern XML Parser written in C++

This XML Parser attempts to create a more modern approach to parsing an XML File. It is noncompliant and intended more for simple xml files with a basic structure.
It does not support doctypes, or mixed node content as of yet, and is still a work in progress.
